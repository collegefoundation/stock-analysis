Stock research :

**Fundamental Analysis: **
This type of research focuses on a company’s financial health, including earnings, revenue, profit margins, debt levels, and growth potential. 
Analysts also look at the industry, competitors, and overall economic conditions. 
Common metrics include the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, earnings per share (EPS), and return on equity (ROE).

**Technical Analysis:**
Technical analysis involves studying historical price movements and trading volumes using charts to predict future price movements. 
This type of research relies on indicators like moving averages,
Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands. It’s more about market psychology and trends than a company’s fundamentals.
